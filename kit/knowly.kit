					<p class="blocks--element--text">Data is an invaluable resource for any company, but 90% of it is unstructured. Attempts to leverage it often fail due to a lack of technical know-how to understand and exploit complex, unstructured data.</p>
					<p class="blocks--element--text">How can you better organise your companyâ€™s content?  How can you keep your head long enough above the water to find what is needed, when you need it ? How can you better take advantage of all the information and personnel experience your company has amassed?</p>
